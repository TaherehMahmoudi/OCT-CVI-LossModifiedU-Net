# Introduction
This project aims to calculate Choroid Vascularity Index (CVI) in optical coherenece tomography (OCT) images, using loss modified U-Net. The method is detailed in "Automatic Choroid Vascularity Index Calculation in Optical Coherence Tomography Images low contrast sclerochoroidal junction Using Deep Learning".
